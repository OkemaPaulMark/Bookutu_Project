# Bookutu Direct Booking System - Implementation Summary

## Overview

Enhanced web and mobile booking functionality for the Bookutu transport system with visual seat selection and dynamic fare calculation.

## What Was Implemented

### 1. Mobile API Enhancements (`api/mobile_serializers.py`)

- **Fixed and aligned** mobile serializers with actual Django models
- **MobileTripSerializer**: Corrected route fields (origin_city/destination_city) and available seats calculation
- **MobileSeatSerializer**: Implemented dynamic pricing using Trip.pricing.calculate_final_fare() with seat multipliers
- **MobileBookingCreateSerializer**:
  - Transaction-safe booking creation with seat reservation locking
  - Validates trip bookability using Trip.is_bookable()
  - Prevents race conditions via SeatReservation unique constraint
  - Computes fares correctly (base + seat fee + service fee)
  - Creates bookings with PENDING status and MOBILE_APP source
- **MobileBookingSerializer**: Returns complete booking details with computed fares and QR codes

### 2. API View Updates (`api/mobile_views.py`)

- **trip_details**: Now passes trip context to MobileSeatSerializer for accurate pricing/availability

### 3. API Tests (`api/tests/test_mobile_booking.py`)

- Happy path: successful booking creation
- Guard: seat already booked (PENDING/CONFIRMED)
- Guard: invalid seat not belonging to bus
- All tests use proper Company/User/Trip/Bus/Route setup

### 4. Web Booking Interface (`templates/company/direct_booking.html`)

A complete, modern multi-step booking flow:

#### Step 1: Route & Trip Selection

- Dropdown to select route from company routes
- Date picker (min: today) for departure date
- Loads available trips via AJAX from `/bookings/direct/trips/`
- Displays trip cards with:
  - Departure/arrival times
  - Bus registration and type
  - Base fare prominently shown
  - Available seats count
  - Bus features (AC, WiFi, Charging)

#### Step 2: Visual Seat Selection

- **Interactive bus layout**:
  - Seats displayed in grid (rows x positions)
  - Color-coded: Available (green), Selected (blue), Booked (red), Reserved (yellow)
  - Hover effects for better UX
  - Driver indicator at the front
  - Aisle gap between seats
- **Real-time fare calculation**:
  - Base fare from trip
  - Seat fee based on seat multiplier
  - Total fare updates on seat click
- **Selection summary sidebar**:
  - Shows selected seat number and type
  - Itemized fare breakdown
  - "Proceed to Passenger Details" button (disabled until seat selected)

#### Step 3: Passenger Details Form

- Full name (required)
- Phone number (required)
- Email (optional)
- ID number (optional)
- Back button to modify seat selection

#### Step 4: Confirmation

- **Trip details**: Route, date, time, seat
- **Passenger details**: Name, phone, email
- **Payment summary**: Base fare + seat fee = total (highlighted)
- "Confirm & Create Booking" button sends POST to `/bookings/direct/create/`

#### Success Flow

- Modal shows booking reference
- Options: "Create Another Booking" or "View All Bookings"

### 5. Backend View (`companies/views.py`)

- **create_booking**: Renders new direct_booking.html template with today's date
- **create_booking_legacy**: Preserved old form-based flow (renamed)

### 6. Features & UX

- **Progress indicators**: 4-step visual tracker showing current/completed steps
- **Responsive design**: Works on desktop and tablet
- **AJAX-powered**: No full page reloads during flow
- **CSRF-protected**: All POST requests include CSRF token
- **Error handling**: Displays alerts for booking failures
- **Accessibility**: Clear labels, focus states, disabled states

## API Endpoints Already Available

### Mobile API

```
POST /api/mobile/bookings/create/
- Auth: IsAuthenticated (JWT Bearer)
- Body: { trip, seat (or seat_number), passenger_name?, passenger_phone?, passenger_email? }
- Response: 201 with booking object or 400 with validation errors
```

### Direct Booking API (used by web interface)

```
GET  /bookings/direct/routes/
GET  /bookings/direct/trips/?route_id=X&departure_date=YYYY-MM-DD
GET  /bookings/direct/trips/{trip_id}/seats/
POST /bookings/direct/reserve-seat/
POST /bookings/direct/create/
```

## How to Use the Web Interface

1. **Access**: Navigate to `/company/bookings/create/` when logged in as company staff
2. **Select route and date**: Choose from dropdown and date picker
3. **Pick a trip**: Click on desired trip card
4. **Select seat**: Click available seat in visual layout (fare updates automatically)
5. **Enter passenger info**: Fill required fields (name, phone)
6. **Confirm**: Review summary and click "Confirm & Create Booking"
7. **Done**: Booking reference displayed; can create another or view list

## Transport Fare Display

- **Base fare**: Always shown from Trip.base_fare
- **Seat fee**: Calculated as `(seat.price_multiplier - 1) * base_fare`
- **Dynamic pricing**: If Trip has pricing, uses `pricing.calculate_final_fare(seat_multiplier)`
- **Real-time updates**: Fare recalculates instantly when seat is clicked

## Technical Notes

### Seat Availability Logic

- Counts bookings with status in ['PENDING', 'CONFIRMED']
- Checks SeatReservation for active, non-expired holds
- Uses database transactions to prevent double-booking

### Consistency with Existing System

- Reuses DirectBookingSerializer for validation
- Compatible with Booking model fields (company, trip, passenger, seat, status, source, etc.)
- Integrates with existing SeatReservation expiry cleanup
- Works alongside direct booking API endpoints

### Styling

- Tailwind CSS for utility classes
- Custom CSS for seat grid and interactions
- Font Awesome for icons
- Responsive breakpoints for mobile/tablet

## Next Steps (Optional Enhancements)

1. **Payment Integration**:

   - Add payment method selection in Step 4
   - POST /api/mobile/payments/initiate/ to create Payment
   - Webhook to transition Booking from PENDING → CONFIRMED
   - Call booking.confirm_booking() to update trip.booked_seats

2. **Multi-Seat Bookings**:

   - Allow selecting multiple seats in one flow
   - Group bookings with order/group ID
   - Bulk seat reservation

3. **Seat Reservation Cleanup**:

   - Celery periodic task to call cleanup_expired_reservations()
   - Auto-release holds after 15 minutes

4. **Enhanced UX**:

   - Save passenger details for quick rebooking
   - Auto-fill from user profile
   - Print/email ticket immediately after confirmation

5. **Mobile App Integration**:
   - Use same API endpoints (`/api/mobile/...`)
   - Implement seat map in Flutter/React Native
   - Push notifications for booking confirmation
