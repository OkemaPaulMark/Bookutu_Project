## Group Integration (Compatibility Layer)

The group project [`Bookutu_Project`](https://github.com/OkemaPaulMark/Bookutu_Project) is vendored at `external/Bookutu_Project/` using a git subtree. We do NOT adopt its models/migrations/settings. Instead, we port compatible API shapes under `api/group-compat/` backed by this project's models and permissions.

### Mounted Compatibility Endpoints

- `GET /api/group-compat/companies/`
- `GET /api/group-compat/buses/`
- `GET /api/group-compat/routes/`
- `GET /api/group-compat/trips/`
- `POST /api/group-compat/trips/{id}/book/` (fields: `seat_number`, `passenger_name`, `passenger_phone`, optional `payment_method`, `payment_status`, `amount_paid`)
- `GET /api/group-compat/bookings/` and `GET /api/group-compat/bookings/{id}/`

### Field Mapping Highlights

- Group `BusCompany` ‚Üí `companies.Company` (uses `id` in responses)
- Group `Bus.number_plate` ‚Üî `companies.Bus.license_plate`
- Group `Bus.is_active` ‚Üî `companies.Bus.status == 'ACTIVE'`
- Group `Route.start_location/end_location` ‚Üî `trips.Route.origin_city/destination_city`
- Group `Trip.departure_time/arrival_time` ‚Üî `trips.Trip.departure_date+departure_time/arrival_time`
- Group `Booking.seat_number` ‚Üî `companies.BusSeat.seat_number`
- Group payment fields map to `payments.Payment` and auto-confirm on completed payments

### Tenancy & Auth

- Endpoints require authentication and honor tenant scoping via `accounts.middleware.TenantMiddleware`.
- Company staff see their company data; other users see only their own bookings.

### Merge Workflow

1. Keep `integrate/group-project` as the working branch for compatibility work.
2. To update the vendored code: `git subtree pull --prefix=external/Bookutu_Project group master --squash`.
3. Port additional endpoints by adapting views/serializers in `group_compat` to local models.
